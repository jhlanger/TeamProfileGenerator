# TeamProfileGenerator

## Purpose
This is a team profile generator. It takes input from a user to create a manager followed by their team which is composed of Engineers and Interns. All employees will have their title, name, ID, and email shown. The links to their email open a new email with the "Send To" field populated by the inputted email address. Each employee has an additional field. Managers have an office number, Engineers have a link to their github and interns have the school they are attending. Once the data is inputted it will generate an html file that creates tables with the inputted data.
